Terralization has been updated to version 1.9.5
Today was a sad day, we removed many mods, and therefore this update will called the great schism. We removed many of the mods, mostly against our will but at the end we needed to get rid of some mods, both because of using too much cpu power and had many bugs in them, we also removed some mods that hadn't been updated in a long time, like since middle 2014.
